# Spigot Plugin Developer Trial Project
I will provide you with a trial plugin to evaluate if you meet the level of DevRoom. The project is to create a Spigot plugin called "Quiz Game" which allows players to participate in a quiz game. The plugin should include multiple categories of questions, and players should be able to select a category to play. The plugin should also keep track of the player's scores and save it to a MariaDB database.

# The features that the plugin should have are:

- Multiple categories of questions
- Players can select a category to play
- Keep track of player's scores
- Save player's scores in a MariaDB database
- A command to start the game
- A command to show the player's scores

# The deliverable for this project is:

- The completed plugin, including all necessary files and configurations
- A detailed documentation on how to use and set up the plugin

You will have 5 days to complete this project.

Good luck and have fun!
